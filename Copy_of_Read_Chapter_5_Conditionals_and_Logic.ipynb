        "3. What is the difference between = and ==? What is the purpose of each one?\n",
        "\n",
        "A:The difference is that 1 = indicates the assingnment operator and 2 == refers to relational operator. = commits to the value and == comapres to the value whether it's the same or not.\n",

        "A:&& is the AND operator, when both statements are ture, the expression will be true and if they are false then the expression will be false. || is OR operator, and if one of conditons are ture then, the expression will be ture and vice versa if it one of the values are false. ! means that the value is not equal to.\n",
